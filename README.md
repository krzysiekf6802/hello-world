# hello-world
Here I will store all the info that I need for "Programming with STM32"   

I played little bit with different uprocessors and evaluation boards (328A, mbed, arduino, Pi) but am still lost in the variety of tools required, how they interact, how they are organized, why do I need them, etc. I tried to follow ST tutorial in SensorTile Curriculum but on the second tutorial someting went wrong with my setup-the bin file could not be found, even it was there where it suppose to be-and I couldn't fix the problem. After unistalling all the relevant programs and files I could not re-install the IDE-it gave me some error mesages.
Now I am following this book by Donald Norris and am wandering if I will be able to follow it to the last page. If I fail again I will be very dissapointed.
